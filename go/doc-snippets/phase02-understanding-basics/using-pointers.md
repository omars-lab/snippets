# Using Pointers

- Pointers are useful since  ... args are always coppied when a method is invoked ... so copying a pointer is lighter than copying an entire struct every time ...
    - [ ] Run a simple example showing how big of a diff ... using pointers instead of structs is ... especially if the struct gets bigger and bigger !
        - Have a long string as one of the values of the struct ....
- Structs are not null-able - but pointers to a struct are! 
- Methods are added to points of a struct ... since its so common to deal with the pointers ... instead of the struct itself ...
